# TODO

* Upgrade library versions.

* Create Docker image for ECS.

* Enforce authorizations on domain object endpoints.
  

* Use `ExceptionGroup`s for multiple concurrent exceptions.

* Use all-mpnet-base-v2 for local embeddings model. (Right now, there's no wheels for python 3.13, so using remote model to create embeddings for now).

* Not needed for this app, but for history, Temporal database: create shadow tables. No foreign keys.
